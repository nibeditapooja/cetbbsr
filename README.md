# some advise
1. First of all i think need all style put on a file it's will be good practice :);
2. For all modifiers set names with content sense;
3. If you want to set color for background-color please don't forget about sharp(#);
4. And a main mistake its using id=intr in all blocks, please use class ;); 
5. And last i recommend use BEM for html structure;
